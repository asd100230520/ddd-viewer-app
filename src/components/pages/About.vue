                    <h2>About 3DSMAPS</h2>
                    <p>
                        3dsmaps, ddd and ddd-viewer are a set of projects designed to generate 3D scenes from
                        <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/about">OpenStreetMap</a> data.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Usage</h3>
                    <p>
                        In the 3D view:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Free & walk mode: Left click to view around. Use <b>W,A,S,D</b> or cursor keys to move. Q and W to move up / down.</li>
                            <li>Orbit mode: Left click to orbit. Right click to pan. Mouse wheel to zooms in/out.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>SHIFT</b> key: change movement speed.</li>
                            <li><b>N/M</b>: change time (affects light).</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Tiles are loaded dynamically. Tiles shown as gray squares are being loaded. Tiles
                        shown in 3D as OpenStreetMap squares are enqueued for server generation (this may
                        take minutes or hours depending on server load). Generated tiles are currently
                        shown after reloading the 3D view. Tiles shown as red squares have errored and cannot
                        be generated in current version.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>NOTE this software is in development stage.</b> Loading and generation times vary
                        depending on server load. <b>Camera
                        may appear far above surface</b> at times during loading. If this happens,
                        try switching to <i>walk</i> mode as it will set the camera above the ground.
                        Orthophotos layers may not be available.
                    </p>


                    <h3>OpenStreetMap</h3>

                    <p>
                        OpenStreetMap is a collectively maintained global mapping database, which includes data that spans ways,
                        roads, shops, train stations and much more.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Everybody can contribute to OpenStreetMap, so if one of your areas of interest is not entirely mapped,
                        you can always step in and contribute to one of the larger collaborative open-data projects in the world.
                        Head to OpenStreetMap site, contact your local OSM Mapping community and start mapping!
                    </p>

                        DDD viewer and software used for 3D generation were created by Jose Juan Montes,
                        who also maintains this demostration server. The following contributors
                        have also contributed to the DDD Viewer project:
