            <h2>About DDD-OSM</h2>

            <p>
                DDD-OSM is a set of tools designed to generate 3D scenes from
                <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/about">OpenStreetMap</a> data.
            </p>

            <h3>Usage</h3>
            <p>
                In the 3D view:
                <ul>
                    <li>Free & walk mode: Left click to view around. Use <b>W,A,S,D</b> or cursor keys to move. Q and W to move up / down.</li>
                    <li>Orbit mode: Left click to orbit. Right click to pan. Mouse wheel to zooms in/out.</li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>SHIFT</b> key: change movement speed.</li>
                    <li><b>N/M</b>: change time (affects light).</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                Tiles are loaded dynamically. Tiles shown as gray squares are being loaded. Tiles
                shown in 3D as OpenStreetMap squares are enqueued for server generation (this may
                take minutes or hours depending on server load). Generated tiles are currently
                shown after reloading the 3D view. Tiles shown as red squares have errored and cannot
                be generated in current version.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>NOTE this software is in development stage.</b> Loading and generation times vary
                depending on server load. <b>Camera
                may appear far above surface</b> at times during loading. If this happens,
                try switching to <i>walk</i> mode as it will set the camera above the ground.
                Orthophotos layers may not be available.
            </p>


            <h3>OpenStreetMap</h3>

            <p>
                OpenStreetMap is a collectively maintained global mapping database, which includes data that spans ways,
                roads, shops, train stations and much more.
            </p>

            <p>
                Everybody can contribute to OpenStreetMap, so if one of your areas of interest is not entirely mapped,
                you can always step in and contribute to one of the larger collaborative open-data projects in the world.
                Head to OpenStreetMap site, contact your local OSM Mapping community and start mapping!
            </p>

            <h3>DDD</h3>

            <p>
                OSM 3D data is rendered using the <a href="https://github.com/jjmontesl/ddd">DDD123 Procedural Geometry Generation Tool</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
                DDD is an Open Source library, looking for contributors. If you are interested in the development of DDD or
                this HTML5 viewer, please head over to the GitHub site and get in contact with the developer community
                or <a href="https://twitter.com/jjmontes" target="_blank">contact me</a>.
            </p>

            <h3>Coverage</h3>
            <p>
                    <center><i>Current Coverage (limited by disk space available for elevation data)</i></center>

            <h3>Authors</h3>

            <p>
                DDD viewer and software used for 3D generation were created by Jose Juan Montes,
                who also maintains this demostration server. The following contributors
                have also contributed to the DDD Viewer project:
            </p>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Farvell</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                You can contribute to the codebase of the generator (DDD), this viewer, or to the OpenStreetMap database.
